# Coarseness

The value of design that is clear. Immediate recognition of the whole, the details second. The glanceable, subconscious impression for mission critical contexts. The gestalt of the thing. Studio vs stage/accessibility â€” support the extreme cases first, and the others benefit.  Coarseness is clear and direct, the opposite of "fine".
